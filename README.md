# Algorithm MRST (McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas)
This algorithm recognizes bipartite Pfaffian graphs efficiently in $O(nm^3)$.

This algorithm was written together with the final article for the completion of the bachelor's degree in computer science at the Intituto Federal do Norte de Minas Gerais (IFNMG).

After clonning the repository, and installed the C++ Boost library, just type `make` to execute.
