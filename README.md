# Algorithm MRST (McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas)
This algorithm recognizes bipartite Pfaffian graphs efficiently in $O(nm^3)$.

As this algorithm does not yet have a specific name, we named this algorithm using the initials of its creators (McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas) to facilitate the reference of this algorithm in my 
[final paper](https://github.com/AlvaroEFMota/mrst/blob/main/AlvaroEFMota%20-%20TCC%20-%20IMPLEMENTA%C3%87%C3%83O%20EFICIENTE%20DE%20ALGORITMO%20PARA%20RECONHECIMENTO%20DE%20GRAFOS%20BIPARTIDOS%20PFAFFIANOS.pdf).

This algorithm was written together with the [final paper](https://github.com/AlvaroEFMota/mrst/blob/main/AlvaroEFMota%20-%20TCC%20-%20IMPLEMENTA%C3%87%C3%83O%20EFICIENTE%20DE%20ALGORITMO%20PARA%20RECONHECIMENTO%20DE%20GRAFOS%20BIPARTIDOS%20PFAFFIANOS.pdf).
 for the completion of the bachelor's degree in computer science at the Intituto Federal do Norte de Minas Gerais (IFNMG).

After clonning the repository, and installed the C++ Boost library, just type `make` to execute.
